Ugxc_ikmjr6bvm1AkZZ4AaABAg,"Hello, Dr. Jane, I'm going to U of Rochester this fall to start my PhD in English.

UgzTbS_loBM6oV8uRhF4AaABAg,"Hello Jane. Please, can you do a video talking about the requirements to apply for PhD programs. I would love it if you discuss whether all PhD programs require research experience, and how graduates with no research experience can get it before applying for PhD research programs.",CC9XKWWVLnY
UgyX85fiyEj9awoDNLp4AaABAg,"It's good that you're ""putting people up on game,"" to use an African American expression, regarding getting funding for conferences. Your point about looking for funding from campus institutions and programs that have a mandate to support minorities or women is a great one. That was one way I was able to fund travel to conferences in places such as Sweden, England and Trinidad & Tobago as a graduate student.

There's another level to this as well: when filling out these applications you need to be very exact in terms of outlining how the money is being spent, making the case for the essential nature of your research, and the value of this chance for professional development. Lastly, get someone who has received one of these travel grants to show you their application, and mirror theirs (in terms of structure, not content obviously) as much as possible.",CC9XKWWVLnY

UgzQMhXM5ouAUsyDYgV4AaABAg,"Solid advice as usual. I'll add one more: don't have pets ü§£. 

Pets can provide emotional support so I get why people would have them, but they are a major expense. And not only did I save money by not having any, I made money during Christmas and summer breaks by watching my advisor's and some of my friends' cats and reptiles. 

Also, I didn't know that in my department we could teach over the summer but after my first year a friend informed me of this. In my department (English) they gave priority to international students for teaching jobs over the summer, so check for similar opportunities in your department. The teaching can be intense: every day for six weeks in my case, but then you have money to pay rent, travel, build your savings, during the break.",GJAkh8gMSbU
